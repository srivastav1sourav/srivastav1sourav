# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases my data analysis projects. Each project offers a brief description and a link to view the details:
## Project 1: Predicting Diabetes in Health Care Data Sets

- **Description:** In this project, I worked with health care data sets to predict whether patients have diabetes or not. I utilized Python and Machine Learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to achieve an 85% prediction accuracy.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Machine Learning, Tableau
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Deployed Random Forest via Python for accurate predictions.
  - Analyzed health data using various charts and tables in Tableau, including histograms, pie charts, and scatter charts.
